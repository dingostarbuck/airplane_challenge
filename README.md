Create With Code Unit 1 Airplane Challenge


This is the Airplane Challenge from Unity's "Create With Code" Unit 1, tasked you with fixing various bugs, such as:

Plane Rotating in the wrong direction
Plane absolutely YEETING itself backwards
Propeller not rotating.


couldn't figure out the collision / hit detection on the walls, assuming it's a mesh thing, as opposed to a rigid body, iunno I'm new here.
